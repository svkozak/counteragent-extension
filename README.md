# Counteragent
A Safari web extension for macOS and iOS/iPadOS to hide a 'foreign agent' banner on some Russian media websites

## The 'foreign agent banner'
As a part of crackdown on independent media, such as [Medusa](www.medusa.io), the russian government designated them as 'foreign agents' and forced to display a large banner on every page.
This extension allows to hide this banner in Safari on macOS or iOS/iPadOS.
